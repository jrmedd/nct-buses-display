# Overview

A little while ago, I produced a [real-time tram stop timetable (for Manchester's Metrolink)](http://github.com/jrmedd/metdisplay) using Open Data from TfGM. After my dad spotted this on a screen behind a bar in MediaCityUK, he asked if I could produce something similar for his local bus stop in Nottingham.

I've created an [endpoint for querying real time bus stop data](https://github.com/jrmedd/nct-buses), which I'm using here to create a dashboard for my parents' hallway.

I'm using the [`react-split-flap-effect` package](https://github.com/jayKayEss/react-split-flap-effect) from @jayKayEss to display the times.
